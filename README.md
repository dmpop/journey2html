# journey2html

journey2html is a Python-based tool for generating static HTML files from Journey backups.

The [Journey](https://2appstudio.com/journey/) journaling app generates backup archives containing JSON and JPEG files. As the name suggests, journey2html makes it possible to generate a nicely-formatted static HTML file out of the backup files.

## Dependencies

The script requires the *lxml* and *markdown* Python modules. To install them on Linux, use the `sudo pip install lxml markdown` command.
